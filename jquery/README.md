# DevExtreme jQuery Floating Action Button Handle Screen Transitions - Getting Started 

This repository stores the code examples of the jQuery Floating Action Button component for the [Getting Started with Floating Action Button - Handle Screen Transitions](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Floating_Action_Button/Getting_Started_with_Floating_Action_Button/#Handle_Screen_Transitions) tutorial. Different screens use different FABs because a FAB should perform or contain only actions that can be performed on a particular screen.
